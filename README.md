# github-traffic-tracker
 
 
## What is this project?
This project is a quick and simple way to keep a long-term history of your github repository traffic (views and clones). As of now (April 2021), github only lets you see the last 2 weeks of traffic for your repositories, which is unfortunate because 2 weeks is not a very long time. So, to keep a longer history, this project uses github's api to fetch traffic data for your public repositories and save it locally as a csv.

Note: The 2-week limit is a github limitation, this repo will not help you get traffic data that's already older than 2 weeks, it simply saves traffic data so it can be viewed later.
